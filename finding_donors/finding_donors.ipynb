    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "\n",
    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",
    "\n",
    "|   | someFeature |                    | someFeature_A | someFeature_B | someFeature_C |\n",
    "| :-: | :-: |                            | :-: | :-: | :-: |\n",
    "| 0 |  B  |  | 0 | 1 | 0 |\n",
    "| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",
    " - Convert the target label `'income_raw'` to numerical entries.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "**Answer: **\n",
    " ### **Gaussian Naive Bayes (GaussianNB)**\n",
    " - Gaussian Naive Bayes model can be used in text analysis i.e. sentiment analysis, checking if an email is spam or not,  classifying news articles into - technology, business etc. It is also used in image processing (in face recognition software).\n",
    "* **Advantages**\n",
    " - It performs better than complex algorithm when data is not large enough (small datasets). \n",
    " - It can be used when you don't want to know the actual probabilty, but want to know the likelihood of an event or a thing.\n",
    " - It requires only a small number of training data to estimate the parameters necessary for classification.\n",
    " \n",
    "* **Where it falls short**\n",
    "   - It makes a naive assumption that all the features are independant and it affects the result in some cases. \n",
    "   - And during binning the data (continous data ), there is chance that you may lose some useful information. \n",
    "   - It works well only when there are less features.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Good candidate?**\n",
    "  - It is a good candidate as we have seen that in the past that GaussianNB is used in census dataset for analysis [2]. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Decision Trees**\n",
    " -   Decision trees can be applied in various real world applications and some of them are \n",
    "        - Financial analysis - It can be used to make a decision to take up a capital project. Or invest in a company or not and so on \n",
    "         - Biomedical Engineering - A decision tree to include a feature in bio-medical implants or not. \n",
    "         - Recommending an app on playstore based on previous installation of an app. \n",
    " * **Advantages**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Decision trees are easy in understand and build. It is like making decisions in real life and represented in the form of tree with root at the top.\n",
    "   - It can handle both numerical and categorical data - Unlike other methods which support only one kind of variable. Decision trees support both numerical and categorical data. \n",
    "   - Decision trees require little data preparation - You don't need to create a dummy varible unlike other models\n",
    "   - Non linears relationship between the parameters don't the performance of the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Where it fall short **\n",
    "     - Decisions tree don't provide accurate results as other models\n",
    "     - Decision trees often lead to overfitting - when you create complex trees, it tends to overfit. \n",
    "     - Decision trees are unstable - a small change in the data will result in a completely different tree. \n",
    "     - There are concepts that are hard to learn as decision trees do not express them easily, such as XOR , and other learning algorithms like inductive logic programming.\n",
    " \n",
    "* **Good candiate?**\n",
    " - Decision tree is easy to understand and requires little data preparation. Hence, it can be used for this problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Support Vector Machines**\n",
    "- Support Vector machines is used in document categorization as their application doesn't require labelling of training data both in standard inductive setting and as well as in transinductive settings. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Advantages**\n",
    " - Kernel trick - you can build in a expert knowledge about the problem by tweaking the kernel. Really helpful for non-linear classification\n",
    " - Support vector machine has a regularization parameter that makes user think about avoiding overfitting the model.\n",
    " - Support vector machine various methods like parameter tuning to get the best possible combination to minimize the error. \n",
    " \n",
    "* **Disadvantages**\n",
    "- SVM's are very complex and needs knowledge of tuning parameters. And kernel trick i.e. playing with kernels requires a lot knowledge and \"trial & errors\".\n",
    "- Other simpler methods are available for linear classifications. \n",
    "- Kernel models can be quite sensitive to over-fitting the model selection criterion\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Good candiate?**\n",
    " - yes, it can be used for the census data and  provides precise and accurate results.  {kernel trick does the perfect job.}\n",

    "### Implementation - Creating a Training and Predicting Pipeline\n",
    "To properly evaluate the performance of each model you've chosen, it's important that you create a training and predicting pipeline that allows you to quickly and effectively train models using various sizes of training data and perform predictions on the testing data. Your implementation here will be used in the following section.\n",
    "In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Import `fbeta_score` and `accuracy_score` from [`sklearn.metrics`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#sklearn-metrics-metrics).\n",
    " - Fit the learner to the sampled training data and record the training time.\n",
    " - Perform predictions on the test data `X_test`, and also on the first 300 training points `X_train[:300]`.\n",
    "   - Record the total prediction time.\n",
    " - Calculate the accuracy score for both the training subset and testing set.\n",
    " - Calculate the F-score for both the training subset and testing set.\n",
    "   - Make sure that you set the `beta` parameter!"

This turns into a tree with two branches at each level.  Then we give some example to the model to tell, how to make decisions and how to classify the data. And it learns from the data. And we give some test data, that we have not used before. And it tries  to predict the answer. We also check the accuracy of the model. \n",

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
